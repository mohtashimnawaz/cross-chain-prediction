# Prediction Market — Frontend (Prototype)

Quick start:

1. cd apps/frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

What this scaffold includes:
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS config
- Basic `WalletConnect` component for MetaMask (EVM) and Phantom (Solana)

Next steps (ideas):
- Integrate with `contracts/PredictionMarketAdapter.sol` to place cross-chain bets
- Read markets from the Anchor program on Solana and show market details
- Add tests and CI workflow
